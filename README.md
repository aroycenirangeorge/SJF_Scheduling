## Aim
To write and execute a C program to implement the Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU
Scheduling algorithm and calculate the Waiting Time (WT) and Turnaround Time (TAT)
for each process along with their average values.
## Algorithm:
- Start the program.
- Read the number of processes n.
- Read the burst time of each process and assign process IDs.
- Sort the processes in ascending order of burst time.
- Assign the waiting time of the first process as 0.
- Calculate the waiting time for the remaining processes using:
WT[i] = WT[i-1] + BT[i-1]
- Calculate the turnaround time for each process using:
TAT[i] = WT[i] + BT[i]
- Display the Process ID, Burst Time, Waiting Time, and Turnaround Time.
- Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
- Stop the program.

## Procedure for Executing the C Program
- Open any C compiler (CodeBlocks).
- Create a new C source file.
- Type or paste the SJF scheduling program.
- Save the file with the .c extension.
- Compile the program.
- Execute the program.
- Enter the number of processes and their burst times.
- Observe the execution order, waiting time, turnaround time, and average values
displayed.

## Program :

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
int n, i, j;
int bt[20], wt[20], tat[20], p[20], temp;
float avg_wt = 0, avg_tat = 0;
printf("Enter number of processes: ");
scanf("%d", &n);
for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
p[i] = i + 1;
printf("Enter Burst Time for P%d: ", i + 1);
scanf("%d", &bt[i]);
}
for(i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
for(j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
if(bt[i] > bt[j]) {
temp = bt[i];
bt[i] = bt[j];
bt[j] = temp;
temp = p[i];
p[i] = p[j];
p[j] = temp;
}
}
}
wt[0] = 0;
for(i = 1; i < n; i++) {
wt[i] = wt[i - 1] + bt[i - 1];
}
for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
tat[i] = wt[i] + bt[i];
}
printf("\nProcess\tBT\tWT\tTAT\n");
for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
printf("P%d\t%d\t%d\t%d\n", p[i], bt[i], wt[i], tat[i]);
avg_wt += wt[i];
avg_tat += tat[i];
}
printf("\nAverage Waiting Time = %.2f", avg_wt / n);
printf("\nAverage Turnaround Time = %.2f\n", avg_tat / n);
return 0;
}
```

## Result :
Thus, the C program to implement the Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling algorithm
was successfully executed. The Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, Average Waiting Time, and
Average Turnaround Time were calculated and displayed successfully.
